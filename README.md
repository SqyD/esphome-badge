# Esphome on conference badges
This is collection of attempts to get ESPHome firmware running on Badgeteam badges. This repository is very much a work in progress. Note that some of these attempts ceased their activity a long time ago and may never progress as most badgeteam members are actively workin on the next hardware and software for an upcoming badge project. So there is no formal commitment or support but we'll accept your contributions.

Right now you can track progress on these badges:
* SHA2017
* MCH2022
* Hackerhotel2024
